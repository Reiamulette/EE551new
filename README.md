# ShakeItUpSchedule
Shake It Up Schedule is a scheduler for events/conventions. As someone who worked on the executive board for two years for a local annual convention, there are many attendees that do not read our program guide and do not explore or take advantage our new activities that are planned to add to the value of having a ticket. 
The app would be able to read an excel file containing details of the event and then take survey results to create a good schedule planned by the scheduler. 
For this project I will use the 2019 events of Castle Point Anime Convention, as this information is the most recent of that of the event. 


1. Having user input an list of events as an excel file. 
2. Ask user for display day of attendance
3. List all events for that day with a "serial code number" side by side
4. if you "look up" a certain serial code number, it will output the event description.
5. Then it will ask you whether you want to participate in AA/DR, how long. Same with Game room. 
6. Then ask you whether you'd like to participate in the maid cafe experience.
7. Then ask if you are interested in the cosplay tournaments.
8. Then ask if you are interested in any of the card/board game tournaments. If you are which ones?
9. Then ask you are you interested in any of the feature guests. If so which?
10. Then, it'd ask you if you are interested in any of the video programming. 
11. Browsing the manga library?
12. Then it'll ask you which genres of panels you are interested in.
13. Then it'll generate a schedule and display it.
14. If you like it, then you can type a command to export it as an excel file back. If you would like to change one particular event, you can look at the events at that time slot and replace it or generate a another event. 
15. Then it can export it as an excel file back and ask you if you would like to generate another schedule from scratch.
